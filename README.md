## Installation
You need to have Java installed before continuing, as the browser refresh module requires it. Additionally, all the required Node modules need to be installed before you can use this template. From the root folder of this project, type `yarn install`. This will create a folder called `node_modules` and download the plugins listed under the `devDependencies` section in the `package.json` file. If you encounter an `ERR!` message about `EACCES`, then you’ll need to run the command as the super user: `sudo npm install`. Because the Gulp tasks amount to about 112MB, expect to wait.

## Tasks
Typing `gulp --tasks`, or simply `gulp`, will provide you with a list of tasks included in `gulpfile.js`. Tasks such as `build` and `serve` invoke other tasks and are nested in the output of `gulp --tasks` and are executed in `<series>`.

Each task can be run on its own. For example, if all you want to do is validate your HTML, you can type `gulp validateHTML`.

## Running the Project
All your work must be added to the sub-folders under the `dev` folder: your markup in `html`, your Sass/CSS in `styles`, your JavaScript in `scripts`, and your images in `img`.

During development, run `gulp serve`, which runs multiple development-related tasks, then launches your default browser and reloads on file changes.

For production-ready projects, run `build`, which creates a folder called `prod`. This is the folder you’d upload to your server if you were going live with your project.
